    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age,age2);
    age=200;
    console.log(age, age2); // expecting => 200 100 

    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;
    
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name,name2); // expecting => wesley wes

    // JS doesn't update the value of a variable if that variable is dependent on another variable

      // i.e here name2 /== 'wesley' because name2 wasn't explicitly told to update

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.table(team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
      // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // now here is the problem!
    console.table(players);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
      // the 'team' variable is referencing the array 'players' and is NOT a copy of it
      // so when you call an index in team to update it, you're really updating `players` because `team` is just an intermediary

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    console.table(team2);
    console.table(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    team4[2] = 'Ayy Lmao';
    console.table(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    // Also have the Array.from() method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
      // Same thing happens to the object, the reference variable serves as an intermediary

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99});
    console.table(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // works the same as Array spreading
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age:100,
      social: {
        twitter:'@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
  
    }
      //console.table(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    console.table(dev);
    // HOWEVER, as noted above, it's only one level deep and any other nested arrays/ objects ARE REFERENCES INSTEAD AND WILL BE OVERWRITTEN IN THE ORIGNAL OBJECT IF YOU UPDATE THE COPY
    
    // you can turn it into a JSON string, and then parse it again into an object BUT this isn't great
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter='@yeet';
    console.table(wes);
